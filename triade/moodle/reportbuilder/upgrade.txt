Information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.0.8 ===

* New database helper method `sql_replace_parameter_names` to help ensure uniqueness of parameters within an expression (where
  that expression can be used multiple times as part of a larger query)
* The local report filter class has a new `get_field_sql_and_params` method which should be used by filter types that re-use
  the filter field SQL within their generated expression, to ensure SQL containing parameters works correctly

* The schedule helper `create_schedule` method accepts a `$timenow` parameter to use for comparisons against current date
  during tests

=== 4.0.6 ===

* The `datasource_stress_test_columns` test helper now enables sorting on those columns that support it
* The `create_[column|filter|condition]` test generator methods now allow for setting all persistent properties

  - `datasource_stress_test_conditions`

=== 4.0.3 ===
